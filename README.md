# Tic-Tac-Toe
This is a game that uses symbols 'X' or 'O' on a 9 square grid. A winner is determined by getting 3 of the same symbols in a row either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. My game was created as my first project for General Assembly.

## Planning Story:
I tried to follow suggested schedule provided by General Assembly. I first started by making a taking each required step and breaking it down into parts. I started with authentication for sign up, sign in, change password and sign out. I then created my gameboard, and then made the gameboard interactive. Once it was interactive I added messages once a winner is determined, or if it is a tie. I didn't quite reach every goal yet, but this is still a work in progress.

## User Stories:
1. I am a user and I want to sign up.
2. I am a user and I'm signed up and I want to to sign in.
3. I am a user and I want to change my password for security purposes.
4. I am a user and want to start a new game.
5. I am a user and I want to know if its my turn.
6. I am a user and want to know if I've won.
7. I am a user and I have not finished my current game, but still want to start a new game.
8. I am a user and I want to see how many games I've played.
I am a user and I want to sign out.

## Technologies Used:
HTML. CSS. Bootstrap. Javascript. Required API. JQuery. Ajax requests. Github.


## Unsolved Problems:
Once signing out then signing back in, cannot retrieve game stats until new game created. Working on resolving.
For a future version, would like to add styling and keep more DRY code overall.
